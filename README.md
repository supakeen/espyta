# espyta

This software provides a webhook handler to automatically flash any ESP-based
devices on your network when the repository for their firmware gets updated.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or up.
- [PlatformIO Core (CLI)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/) 5.0 or up.

## Installation

I recommend you use a virtual environment and use that to install `espyta`. You
can then start the `espyta` HTTP server as follows:

```
# python3.8 -m venv venv
# venv/bin/pip install espyta
# venv/bin/espyta http
````
